# Autonomous Driving - Car Detection

## Introduction
This project implements an object detection system for autonomous driving using the YOLO (You Only Look Once) algorithm. YOLO is a popular object detection algorithm known for its real-time performance and high accuracy.

## Features
- Detect objects in images using a pre-trained YOLO model.
- Filter bounding boxes based on confidence thresholds.
- Perform Non-Max Suppression (NMS) to eliminate redundant bounding boxes.
- Visualize detected objects with bounding boxes and class labels.
